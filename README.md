# BankingServicesCaseStudy
This repository contains all the variations of a simple banking software I made during my internship in Capgemini . This repository is entirely projecased on JEE , Java , Spring and Hibernate.

In this basic software you can make a new account , depending on the type of accunt - Savings or Current. A random pin and account number is generated for every account. 
The accounts can be used to the basic transactions like opening new account , withdraw money, deposit money and fund transfers between the accounts. 
For all transactions , pin verification is required. Also for all transactions , transaction history is saved as a record which can be acessed for particular account.
